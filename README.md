# Comparing the Sugar and Sodium Content of 80 Cereals

With a data set from Kaggle I compare the sugar and sodium contents of 80 cereals on in the US market.
Summary of what I did:

* Interactive plot of the 80 cereals using plotly.
* Animated bar chart of the 7 manufacturers using gganimate.
* User-Defined Function that returns the nutritional values of cereals.
* Shiny Dashboard that shows the nutritional values and plot of the 80 cereals.
